When I started looking for selection of courses, I was thoroughly confused about the many options for management only courses, and when I came across CTM, I knew this was the perfect one that I was looking for. The course is a mix of modern management theory and latest technology, which is going to change the future of technology.

    <p>I came from Korea to start a new business in India.

CTM has enabled me to learn about the current market trends in both technical and management stream. It has the perfect blend of classroom plus online learnings which helps working professionals to go through the course in a flexible yet organised manner. Additionally, the group/individual project work, webinars, plant visit, discussion forums help acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. I am positive that learning the core management concepts and acquiring a strong foundation in Data Science will help me perform and contribute in a more effective manner, both as a consultant and team leader.

      <p>Being in IT industry for a sufficient period of time,the scope of growth was becoming limited.CTM was the perfect choice when I wanted to broaden my choices in my career. The unique feature was that we get to learn both Technical (Data Science/Machine Learning) and Management subjects under one roof. Another striking aspect was diversity of the batch comprisingstudents from other nationalities, expats & other industries, that I could not have experiencedat any other place. This course is a perfect pit stop, where a person could imbibe the learnings from eminent professors to enable their personal & professional growth.

      <p>All through my 12 year career, I have worked in the infrastructure side of the software systems. When I was looking for a course in an alternate domain like Data Science from premium institutes, there was nothing like CTM which is backed by IIMB & IITM. It gives a holistic view on the technical and the management perspective.The classroom sessions proved to be a great learning experience. This programme will open the gates to the Data Science perspective for someone looking for a career in this domain or to have a better understanding of the complete picture.The journey has been challenging but with a lot of learning. This is much more than a certification program and the industry needs more of this kind.
