  <p>I was searching for a programme from premier institutes and when I found CTM, I knew this was the one to enhance my skills, while being employed. The journey has been tough but rewarding. Campus connect sessions and the live discussions with the IIM/IIT Faculty is an ultimate experience. Weekly assignments with strict deadlines ensures that I stay on my toes and learn with the similar pace as others. I believe these 10 months will help me become a better professional in several areas.</p>
