      The IIMBx programme is founded on the philosophy that everyone – irrespective of financial or regional constraints – should have access to quality education. IIMB started offering Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in 2014 through its digital learning initiative, IIMBx in partnership with edX – a not for profit online initiative of Harvard and MIT. Over the last three years, IIMBx has grown to receive over 1000000 learners from 190 countries. Apart from edX, the programme offers courses on SWAYAM and its own platform, IIMBx. Led by IIMB faculty, IIMBx uses digital learning tools to enable ‘anytime, anywhere learning’ in a global classroom.

    <h3>The IIMBx Growth Story</h3>
    <p>
      IIMBx has had an eventful journey over the last few years and has grown into one of the most significant hubs for online learning in India. The course was offered on edX in 2015.In 2016, IIMB was appointed as a National Coordinator for management courses on SWAYAM, India’s learning portal launched by the Ministry of Human Resource Development. Simultaneously IIMB also started offering courses on IIMBx, using the Open edX platform. With over 35 courses reaching more than a million learners from 190 countries, IIMBx is an emerging leader in India’s fast-growing digital space. Interestingly only a third of these learners are from India, with more learners from US, Europe and Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      IIMBx’ s vision is to create a positive social impact by leveraging educational technology to create a world-class repository of digital courseware in management for learners across the globe. In the long run, IIMBx aims to be a thought leader and preferred digital hub for management education supporting managers, academics and institutions across Asia and Africa.
    </p>

    <h3>IIMBx’ s Social Impact</h3>
    <p>
      To build institutional capacity in education and help educators across the country keep up with global trends, IIMBx organizes faculty development programmes, workshops, and an annual conference on the future of learning, which draws participants from academia, industry and policy alike. A few examples of IIMBx’ s social impact initiatives are mentioned below:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        IIMB’s learners come from all strata of society. IIMBx tries to support learners by providing access to the courses through the three learning platforms which offer these courses, namely, SWAYAM, edX and IIMBx.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the blended courses on IIMBx, which may involve significant faculty time during the courses, IIMBx offers considerable amount of support by way of discounted fees.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working with corporate social responsibility, the IIMBx department is exploring how basic certification in management can be offered at highly discounted rates to university students. The proposal is now under consideration with a few leading corporate organizations.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Institutional Partnerships</h3>
